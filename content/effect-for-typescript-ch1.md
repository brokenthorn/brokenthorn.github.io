This is the first post in a series on Effect, a library that makes it easier to write
production-grade TypeScript at scale, where I plan to show you why I would prefer to write
TypeScript with Effect all the time, if that were possible.

By taking a pragmatic approach to Functional Programming, Effect makes it easier to deal with some
of the things &mdash; and I would argue, most of the things &mdash; one has to deal with when
writing TypeScript at scale: <mark>concurrency</mark>, <mark>error handling</mark>, <mark>side
effects</mark>, <mark>retry policies</mark>, <mark>back pressure</mark>, <mark>logging</mark>,
<mark>observability (tracing)</mark>, <mark>schema validations</mark>, and more.

Hopefully by the end of these articles I would have convinced you to at least try it out.

## What is Effect? {#what-is-effect}

Effect is a modular library with tons of goodies inside that I will try to get into in the next
posts.

But, the star of the library is the `Effect` data type, which is an abstraction for managing side
effects, and more.

Effect has built what's called an [Effect System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system), a
formal system for describing side effects and computations, making them easier to check at
compile-time, so you get more compile-time guarantees from TypeScript about your code than you would
get otherwise, especially when it comes to errors.

Effect also supports [structured concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency),
a programming paradigm that improves clarity, quality and reliability of asynchronous programs, by
using a structured approach to concurrency, i.e. it allows control flow to remain readily evident by
the structure of the source code, despite presence of concurrency.

The Effect System together with the structured approach to concurrency, makes it easier to reason
about asynchronous code and side effects.

## Do I need to know Functional Programming?

In order to learn how to use Effect correctly you should be somewhat proficient with TypeScript. You
should be comfortable with: types, functions, generator functions, function overloads, and generics.

It's not necessary to know Functional Programming to understand Effect, but if you do, it will help
you pick it up faster.

Effect makes use of some Functional Programming concepts like higher-order functions, building
functional pipelines, immutability, lazy execution, data-first and data-last functions, none of
which are hard to understand from a couple of examples.

Effect focuses on actual usage in real-world scenarios so it eschews a lot of abstract ideas often
touted by more hard core or pure functional programming languages/libraries. It makes an effort to
let you write the simplest code you can in the way you find easiest to write or understand, be it
declarative or imperative.

## Documentation

Official documentation: [https://effect.website/docs/](https://effect.website/docs/).\
I strongly recommend you read the "Getting started" section, it's very good.

A full API reference is also available
[here](https://effect.website/docs/additional-resources/api-reference/).

## Live Playground

You can play with Effect in the Live Playground:
[https://effect.website/play/](https://effect.website/play/).

It features hot-reload, a terminal, and a local trace viewer (Effect DevTools).

It's great for experimentation and creating minimal reproducible examples (MREs) before seeking
help. Just use the built-in share functionality.

## Discord

There is an Effect community on Discord, which you can join at
[https://discord.gg/effect-ts](https://discord.gg/effect-ts).

## Who's using Effect?

Companies like Vercel and Zendesk already use Effect in production, and the future looks promising
in terms of adoption.

For more testimonials and adoption stories, check out the
[Effect Podcast](https://effect.website/podcast/) and the
[Effect YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@effect-ts). Also the job board on Discord might be
helpful.

Effect was also featured in
[Thoughtworks' April 2025 Techonology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/radar/2025/04/tr_technology_radar_vol_32_en.pdf),
saying:

> Effect is a powerful TypeScript library for building complex synchronous and asynchronous
> programs. Web application development often requires boilerplate code for tasks such as
> asynchrony, concurrency, state management and error handling. Effect-TS streamlines these
> processes using a functional programming approach. Leveraging TypeScriptâ€™s type system, Effect
> helps catch hard-to-detect issues at compile time. Our team previously used fp-ts for functional
> programming but found that Effect-TS provides abstractions that align more closely with daily
> tasks. It also makes code easier to combine and test. While traditional approaches like
> Promise/try-catch or async/await can handle such scenarios, after using Effect, our team found no
> reason to go back.

## Is that all?

Nope, but I decided to keep the first post as a short high-level introduction.

In the next post I will cover the `Effect` data type that I only briefly mentioned
[above](@/effect-for-typescript-ch1.md#what-is-effect).

I'll explain what it is, what it does, and how it compares to something like `Promise<T>`.
