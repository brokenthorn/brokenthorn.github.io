# Intro to series

This is the first post in a series about [Effect](https://effect.website/), a
set of libraries for writing better TypeScript at scale.

The series is succinct and to the point, leaving you free to explore on your
own. Consider these articles as starting points to spark your interest in
coding with Effect.

## What is Effect and what does it provide?

Effect is a toolkit for TypeScript and sometimes it's described as the missing
standard library for TypeScript.

But I find that to be innacurate, because the Node.js SDK and the standard Web
APIs are already a stdlib.

There is an issue though. This standard library is sometimes implemented
slightly differently between JavaScript runtimes, while some runtimes extend
the stdlib, adding things like a sqlite client, or a kv store and client, etc.

Effect tries to build a common abstraction over these platforms/runtimes,
although it's not comprehensive and probably never will be.

The [Effect monorepo](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main) is
composed of many packages (modules). Here are the ones available at the time of
writing to give you an idea of what it offers:

- [ai](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/ai) – Library for building provider-agnostic AI chat agents, MCP servers, etc.
- [cli](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/cli) – Library for building CLI tools or to give your app the ability to accept and easily validate command-line parameters
- [cluster](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/cluster) – Distributed runtime for creating robust, scalable, fault-tolerant applications in TypeScript
- [experimental](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/experimental) – Unpolished libraries and DevTools (e.g. live local traces)
- [opentelemetry](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/opentelemetry) – OpenTelemetry integration

- [platform-node](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/platform-node) – Node.js platform abstractions (sockets, file system, etc.)
- [platform](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/platform) – Platform-independent high-level abstractions (servers, clients, etc.)
- [printer-ansi](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/printer-ansi) – ANSI-style printer utilities
- [printer](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/printer) – Core printing utilities
- [rpc](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/rpc) – Type-safe RPC (similar to tRPC)

- [sql-clickhouse](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-clickhouse)
- [sql-d1](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-d1)
- [sql-drizzle](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-drizzle)
- [sql-kysely](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-kysely)
- [sql-libsql](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-libsql)
- [sql-mssql](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-mssql)
- [sql-mysql2](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-mysql2)
- [sql-pg](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-pg) – PostgreSQL client implementations
- [sql-sqlite-bun](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-sqlite-bun)
- [sql-sqlite-do](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-sqlite-do)
- [sql-sqlite-node](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-sqlite-node)
- [sql-sqlite-react-native](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-sqlite-react-native)
- [sql-sqlite-wasm](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/sql-sqlite-wasm)
- [typeclass](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/typeclass)
- [vitest](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/vitest)
- [workflow](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/workflow) – Durable workflows


But the package everyone should start with is the core `effect` module:

## Finding Help & Documentation 

### Official documentation

Effect's documentation is continuously improving. At the time of writing, it's
the best it has ever been: straightforward and easy to follow. This assumes you
have basic TypeScript knowledge&mdash;generics, generators, overloads, ES modules&mdash;and
can wrap your head around some functional programming (FP) concepts such as
function currying, the pipe operator, immutability, pure functions, and
data-first/data-last APIs.

Don't worry&mdash;Effect simplifies FP concepts to make the library approachable and
it doesn't force FP on you. It doesn't require you to know FP either, but
familiarity helps (because it makes some patterns more intuitive).

You can access the docs at https://effect.website/docs/ or via the Docs link in
the top navigation bar of https://effect.website/.

### Playground

There's also an online playground at https://effect.website/play/ (accessible
from the nav bar) where you can immediately start playing around with Effect,
especially as you're learning it, and you can see result in realtime with
hot-reload. It has a terminal output and a trace viewer!

It's also great for experimenting with Effect or creating minimal reproducible
examples (MREs) before seeking help on the Discord community server.

### Discord server

The Discord server is linked from the homepage's nav bar, or join directly at
https://discord.gg/effect-ts.

I found it to be a very welcoming and helpful community, but before asking
complex questions, please make sure to create an MRE on the playground and
click the share button to copy a link to it.

## Do you need to fully adopt it to get started?

This is the first question many newcomers ask.

No. Effect is incrementally adoptable, making it easy to introduce in small or
simple use cases. However, this flexibility primarily serves to ease the
transition.

If you attempt to use it at scale without fully adopting its patterns&mdash;forcing
code to fit&mdash;you'll introduce complexity and wrongly blame Effect. Idiomatic
Effect code is succinct and expressive, but you'll only experience this by
embracing its principles or exploring well-written codebases that leverage
Effect fully.

Just thought I'd warn you before you let things get messy and start blaming the
wrong person/thing. Don't ask me how I know this.

## What value does it provide?

In one sentence, Effect provides *probably the best way* to write robust
TypeScript applications at scale (and for the cloud), *from my experience*.

For me, some of its main advantages are:

- It brings errors as values to TypeScript in a fully type-safe, fully inferred
way, offering a significant step up in error handling compared to throwing
exceptions.
- It’s the easiest way to create extensible, composable, reusable, and testable
code in TypeScript. For example, adding telemetry and logging is a breeze, and
observability is unmatched.
- Composable by design: adding retries, granular error handling, interruptions,
and side effects (taps) is easier than anywhere else, except perhaps other
programming languages that are functional by design.
- It blurs the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous functions
(function coloring).
- The number of building blocks it provides is staggering&mdash;data
structures, async queues, pub/sub, streams, mutexes (semaphores), configuration
and dependency management, and more.

There’s too much value to try to describe in words. Programmers value code, so
I plan to show plenty of code examples in the following articles.

## What’s next?

That concludes the introduction.

In the next article, I’ll dive into the core `effect` library and its most
interesting data type, also called `Effect`. I’ll explain what an Effect is,
why it exists, how it compares to existing abstractions, and why it’s better.
